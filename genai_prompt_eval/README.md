# Generative AI Evaluation & Prompt Tuning Pipeline

This project showcases a simulated Generative AI workflow focused on **LLM prompt evaluation**, **response quality analysis**, and **REST API integration**.

It is inspired by my real-world work under Scale AI (Outlier), where I was involved in enterprise-level LLM training, prompt testing, and model behavior refinement.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repo simulates an internal tool for evaluating LLM outputs based on predefined rubrics such as:

- Instruction Following  
- Relevance  
- Depth & Completeness  
- Hallucination Check  
- Tone & Formality  

The goal is to demonstrate how LLMs can be evaluated and improved via structured prompt engineering and iterative feedback cycles.

## 🧠 Real Experience

**Role:** LLM Prompt & Model Trainer at Scale AI  
**Duration:** 5+ months (Outlier Projects)

### Responsibilities:
- Evaluated and ranked LLM responses across a variety of complex prompts
- Designed adversarial prompts to "break" the model or expose edge cases
- Conducted rubric-based analysis on outputs
- Worked on model behavior improvement through structured feedback loops
- Contributed to human-AI alignment research tasks

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Used Here (Simulation)
- Python
- FastAPI (for simulated REST API)
- Dummy prompt-response examples

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

```python
Input Prompt: "Explain the greenhouse effect to a 10-year-old."
LLM Output: "The greenhouse effect is like a blanket around the Earth..."
Evaluation: ✅ Instruction Followed, ✅ Relevance, ✅ Simplicity
```
